# faceID-opencv

This is a facial recognition program made to replicate the likes of Face ID or Windows Hello. The program was made using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifer models. There are a couple training pictures in the 'images' directory used to train the model. The face recognition tries to identify a face captured by the camera. If a familiar face is identified and matches with the devices 'user-id', the device will be unlocked.
